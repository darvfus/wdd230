        <p>
            And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young,
            nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to know of the amysteries of God, 
            wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did bvisit me, and did csoften my heart that I did dbelieve 
            all the words which had been spoken by my efather; wherefore, I did not frebel against him like unto my brothers.

        <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
        <p>
            And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded,
             for I know that the Lord giveth no bcommandments unto the children of men,
             save he shall cprepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.
